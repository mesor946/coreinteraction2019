		<strong>Notes for Reading 5:</strong> <em>A Handmade Web</em>

		<br><br><br><br>


	<em>"I evoke the term 'handmade web' in order to draw attention both to the manual labour involved in the composition of web pages, and the functioning of the web page itself as a 'manual', a 'handbook', a set of instructions required for a computer program to run."</em>
	<br><br>
	I feel like the idea of a "handmade web" would be extremely beneficial to most people, not just artists. We do depend too much on other sites like Facebook and Instagram to host our identities online, and in doing so, we relinquish control. However, there is an issue of accessibility. For someone to be able to make their own webpage, even a basic one, they have to 1. Have access to a computer (which not everyone does) and 2. Know how to code. Even basic html and css require knowledge and someone to teach you. Before coming to college, I tried to teach myself how to code, but honestly, it was extremely difficult, and I am only now beginning to understand how these languages work after two semesters worth of university coding classes- an opportunity which many people do not have. If we want to create a new "Web 1.0" we have to make coding more accesible and easy to understand for people with no previous experience, and we also have to make it free.
