	<em>"To paraphrase Croatian artist Mladen Stilinović’s 1994 banner embroidered with the claim that ‘an artist who cannot speak English is no artist’, today one could say that a young artist who doesn’t have a website is no artist.Stilinović comes to mind because his maxim is a statement about access and the prerequisites for participation in the art industry"</em>
	<br><br>
	This presents an interesting point about the issue of accesibility and priviledge. When it comes to webdesign, that entails having the means and the time to both have access to a computer/technology and have the time and skill(or the ability to learn the skills) required to build a website. If an aspiring artist or designer wants to create a website, but does not have access, does that mean that they are essentially unable to participate in the art industry?
	<br><br><br>
	<em>"This is not reflected in artists’ websites: a small number of platforms such as Indexhibit and Cargo Collective are used by a large majority of artists when building their sites, responding to a checklist of unchanging components (CV, contact information, images). The consequence is that artists’ websites rarely do justice to their work."</em>
	<br><br>
	I find it interesting that most artists (and I am guilty of this) feel the need to have a website that has a certain "look" i.e. clean, lots of white space, organised and uniformly sized thumbnails. I think the reason for this is 1. websites that look like this are deemed more "acceptable" or expected, and 2. if an artist has limited knowledge to code their own website, they are going to rely on other platforms (wix,squarespace, tumblr, instagram, etc.) which are extremely generic and do not allow for much self-expression.
	<br><br><br>
	<em>"Instead, it looks at the artist’s website as what it could be: an online
	exhibition platform. "</em>
	<br><br>
	I disagree or wish the author would elaborate, I think that an artist's website has the potential to be more than an online exhibition platform, it could also be its own seperate piece of work, representative of the artist and their style.
	<br><br><br>
	<em>" One of the reasons for that is access: to start an online exhibition platform requires programming knowledge. It’s a requirement not only in order to build such a platform, but also simply to be able to imagine what is possible when working online. The lattergoes for both the artist and the curator working online"</em>
	<br><br>
	This part goes to the point that I was making above.
	<br><br><br>
	<em>"It could be a place to experiment, to try out ideas, and to connect with viewers. Such a website will generate an engagement rare at the moment: visitors might tune in periodically to see what’s on view, just as they would step into a familiar gallery."</em>
	<br><br>
	I think it is conceptually interesting for an artist's website to be something that evolves and changes over time, instead of merely a static archive and documentation of their previous work.
