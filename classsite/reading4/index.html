		<strong>Notes for Reading 4:</strong> <em>Research & Destroy: A Plea for Design as Research</em>

		<br><br><br><br>


	<em>"We no longer have any desire for design that is driven by need. Something less prestigious than a ‘designed’ object can do the same thing for less money. The Porsche Cayenne brings you home, but any car will do the same thing, certainly less expensively and probably just as quickly."</em>
	<br><br>
	While this is partly true, some objects do need to be designed in a specific way otherwise they will not function properly. Or for example, some objects could be designed differently/ better to make them more accessible. 
	<br><br><br>
	<em>"The ambition of the designer always leads beyond his discipline and his official mandate, without this above-and-beyond having a diploma or even a name of its own. Still, it is remarkable that design, as an intrinsic activity, as an objective in itself, enjoys far less respect than the combination of design and one or more other specialisms. A pioneering designer does more than just design – and it is precisely this that gives design meaning. Willem Sandberg was a graphic designer, but he was also the director of the Amsterdam Stedelijk Museum (for which he did his most famous work, in the combined role of designer and his own client). Wim Crouwel was a graphic designer, but also a model, a politician, stylist and later, also a museum director. "</em>
	<br><br>
	I agree with the author that a designer, especially a communication designer, wears many hats and has many roles, and also if a designer or artist is self-employed they must take on even more roles, which can be challenging, but also allows for more control over one's destiny and creative process.
