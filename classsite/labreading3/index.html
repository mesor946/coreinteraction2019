	<strong>Notes for Reading 3:</strong> <em>Kameelah Janan Rasheed on research and archiving </em>

	<br><br>

	<h2>describe why each writer thinks collecting is important. </h2>

<br><br>

<p> For Kameelah Janan Rasheed, research is important because it is "generative". Research allows you one to explore and learn about things that they may not have discovered if they had just asked a question and gotten an immediate answer. Research also allows you to make connections to information beyond the scope of your question and then bring those detail and relate them back to what you were originally wondering about. Collecting and archiving allows you to create a reference point for yourself and also create an archive, providing access and new information to others.</p>

<em>Rutherford Chang on the art of collection </em>

<br><br>

<p> For Rutherford Chang, collecting is important because it is a way of documenting life. However, if you have a very strict or narrow scope of collection and (according to him) if you have enough items in your collection, then it can become something seperate from you, or take on a life of its own. For example. He collected the Beatles <em>White ALbum</em> for a very long time, and at first he was only collecting the album for himself, because he liked seeing the change from one copy of the album to another. Even though they are the same, they are also different , and each copy connects him to another person and another life that the physical copy of the album has been a part of. Eventually he had so many copies of the Alum that he was able to give it a life of its' own, make the collection into an art piece, and once again have other people come, interact, and connect with it. </p>

<em>Ordinary plenty </em>

<br><br>

<p> For this author, collecting is important because it gives others some insight into your experience. Even trivial goings on and the day to day are important because they make up a person. Also collecting and preserving seemingly banal items/prose/ideas/iamges etc. is important because it is humanizing.
