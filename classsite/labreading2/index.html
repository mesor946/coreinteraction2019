A flexbox is a parent whose properties affect the children inside. When you create a flexbox, it looks on the outside like a normal element and fall according to the inline flow, like any div, or p tag. Inside the flexbox, the items inside the container respond to the properties that we give the flexbox. These elements can be laid out differently inside the box. The flexbox has different properties, such as flex-direction (row, column, row-reverse, or column-reverse) which affects how the elements inside the box stack up/ line up.

<em>What We Mean When We Say “responsive”</em>

<br><br>

Responsive can mean many different things. In the primary sense, responsive web design is fluid layouts, flexible images (and media objects), and media queries. However, "responsive" can also imply an adaptive or device appropriate web design. For example, a web page that changes depending on if you are on the phone or a computer. It "responds" depending upon the situation or screen size.
