		<strong>Notes for Reading 6:</strong> <em>material.io</em>

	<em>"Material is an adaptable system of guidelines, components, and tools that support the best practices of user interface design. Backed by open-source code, Material streamlines collaboration between designers and developers, and helps teams quickly build beautiful products."</em>
	<br><br>
	I went through the material site. Over the course of flipping through and reading multiple pages, I realized that this is quite a comprehensive design guide. because the rules/ guidlines are so comprehensive, it could make life easier for a web designer who is just trying to make something that is aesthetically appealing and look and feel "professional". It could also be helpful to those who are new at coding or webdesign and do not know where to start. This type of design probably satisfies many different clients; however, in my personal opinion, having a template for everything runs the risk of everyone's websites looking the same and generic, and as an aspiring designer, that is something that I try and avoid.
