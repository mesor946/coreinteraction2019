<strong>Notes for Reading 2:</strong> <em>Exercises in Style</em>

<br><br><br><br>

I have seen/read this work before. I thought it interesting, and also challenging. Usually when I am given a prompt for a project or a design brief, I come up with one concept and stick with it. Reading "Exercises in Style", I find myself thinking about the benfits of prototyping and iterative thinking. The different "styles" of writing just show that there are multiple solutions to one problem, and are worthwhile to explore.

It is also interesting to consider that there was a debate around the work being considered a piece of literature, or maybe how it was treated as such by the French and then not so much by the British. The work questions what it means to tell a story, and also what it means to have a style or a voice. Since Queneau was able to write in many different ways, is it fair to say that he does not have a distinct style? I'm not sure what the answer to this question is, I think I would have to read more of his work to find out.
