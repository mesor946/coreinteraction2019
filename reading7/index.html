		<strong>Notes for Reading 7:</strong> <em>Can Jokes Bring Down the Government</em>

	<em>". Memes play a distinct role in protest; they seem to be to the resistance of today what “political posters” were to yesterday – the embodiment of shared ideas in a community. They can be JPEGs, or rumours. Indeed, part of their appeal is that memes seem to spread spontaneously"</em>
	<br><br>
	I think it is worth noting that memes are sometimes taken very seriously. For example <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/04/06/europe/russia-gay-clown-putin/index.html">this meme</a> of Putin was banned by the Russian government. I completely agree with the author that memes are a form of political satire. 
	<br><br><br>

<em> "Memes take on a wide variety of forms and formats, but they do their work right in the human brain. Time, explained Dawkins, constitutes a major limit on the success of individual memes. No one person can do more than only a few things at once. Consequently, said Richard Dawkins, “if a memeis to dominate the attention of a human brain, it must do so at the expense of ‘rival’ memes.”</em>

<br><br>

I disagree with this because I can understand multiple different memes and also old memes and although memes go out of style I don't believe that they are competeing with each other.
