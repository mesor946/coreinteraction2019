The artists explored the roles of the immune system and created visual representations of how an external immune system would appear.

		<em>Sea Urchin Rave Outfit</em>, by Rebecca Mesonjnik, was created using mixed media, with the two main components being items of revealing clothing and cardboard cones. The outfit is directly <strong>confrontational</strong>, forcing the viewer to keep their distance, and defending the wearer from unwanted physical contact.
