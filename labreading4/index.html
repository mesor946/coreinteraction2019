	<br><br>

	<h2>formulate three well thought out questions you have after/while reading this that you would like the answers to. </h2>

<br><br>

<ol>

	<li>what does it mean to be "server-side" vs inside the browser?</li>
	<li> If "when a feature is available in a declarative language, not only is it easier to write, itâ€™s also more robust" then why must we use imperative languages at all?</li>
	<li>"Web designers would do well to remember what the advertising industry chose to ignore: on the web, the user has the final say."I think it is interesting that as a communication designer I could be working in advertising and might very well be developing or coding,also, do designers and computer programmers always have to be at odds with each other?</li>
</ol>
