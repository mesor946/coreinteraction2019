<strong>Notes for Reading 1:</strong> <em>About Low-Tech Magazine's Solar Powered Website</em>

<br><br>

Although this reading was highly technical in some aspects, mainly explaining how the author's system works/ the specifics of the software and hardware, it was very enlightening because I usually do not think about how much energy and physical space the internet and websites in general take up. I didn't realize how much energy it takes to sustain the interent, and how there are physical aspects of the internet that we do not usually think about.

<em>Accessibility according to actual people with disabilities</em>

<br><br>

I am very interested in the accessibility of information in general, whether that be through typography, media, or online. This article was both informative but also disheartening, seeing as the internet is so difficult to utilize for so many. It is also frustrating because so many accessibility issues are soooo easy to fix, the fact that web designers can't spend a minute amount of effort into majorly improving people's lives is upsetting.

<em>How to learn CSS</em>

<br><br>

truth be told, this reading was very long and confusing. I think it would be helpful to seperate it into different sections, and much of the material in the reading I already covered last semester. This actually kind of goes back to the "Accessibility" reading, because one long block of text is not condusive to keeping someone's attention.
