<strong>Notes for Reading 1:</strong> <em>My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge. What could yours be?</em>

“Although they may seem initially accommodating and convenient to their users, universally popular social media sites—like Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and Pinterest—are private companies that prioritize advertising above their users’ needs. Their users’ happiness is not the primary focus, so it’s perfectly normal for you to feel anxiety when using or even thinking about social media. In this age of digital cacophony dominated by these platforms, no one is looking out for you… but you”

This is an interesting statement because it is true but also extremely cynical. I would disagree in part because some websites or aspects of websites are created purely for art’s sake or for the delight of the user...although those sites are uncommon.

<br><br>

“To those creative people who say “I don’t need a website,” I ask: why not have a personal website that works strategically, in parallel to your other activities? How could a website complement what you already do rather than competing or repeating? How can you make it fun or thought-provoking or (insert desired feeling here) for you? How can the process of making and cultivating a website contribute to your approach?”

I think this statement is interesting. I don’t remember who I was speaking to, but I think it was a professor who said that (as an artist) almost no one is going to find you or hire you based on randomly finding your website. If that is the case, then why not make your website a standalone piece of art that represents your brand instead of merely a portfolio or archive of your work.
