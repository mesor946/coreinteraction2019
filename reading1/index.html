<strong>Notes for Reading 1:</strong> <em>About Low-Tech Magazine's Solar Powered Website</em>

<br><br>

Although this reading was highly technical in some aspects, mainly explaining how the author's system works/ the specifics of the software and hardware, it was very enlightening because I usually do not think about how much energy and physical space the internet and websites in general take up. I didn't realize how much energy it takes to sustain the interent, and how there are physical aspects of the internet that we do not usually think about.

<em>Accessibility according to actual people with disabilities</em>

<br><br>

I am very interested in the accesibility of information in general, whether that be through typography, media, or online. This article was both informative but also disheartening, seeing as the internet is so difficult to utilize for so many. It is also frustrating because so many accesibility issues are soooo easy to fix, the fact that web designers can't spend a minute amount of effort into majorly improving people's lives is upsetting.

“To those creative people who say “I don’t need a website,” I ask: why not have a personal website that works strategically, in parallel to your other activities? How could a website complement what you already do rather than competing or repeating? How can you make it fun or thought-provoking or (insert desired feeling here) for you? How can the process of making and cultivating a website contribute to your approach?”

I think this statement is interesting. I don’t remember who I was speaking to, but I think it was a professor who said that (as an artist) almost no one is going to find you or hire you based on randomly finding your website. If that is the case, then why not make your website a standalone piece of art that represents your brand instead of merely a portfolio or archive of your work.
